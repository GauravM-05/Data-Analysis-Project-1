## Overview
This project analyzes booking and search session data to uncover user behavior patterns. It focuses on key metrics like search time, booking sessions, and the relationship between variables such as the day of the week and booking success rates. The goal is to identify trends that can inform decision-making and optimize the user experience.

## Key Feartures
Data preprocessing and merging of multiple datasets.
Analysis of search session patterns based on the time and day of the week.
Grouping and calculating metrics to observe booking success rates (BSR) by day.
Visualizing trends to understand when users are more likely to book.

## Technology Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Technical Aspect
The project uses Python for data manipulation and analysis, leveraging libraries such as Pandas for data preprocessing, merging, and aggregation. Key metrics like search time and booking success rates (BSR) are computed by grouping the data based on different variables, such as the day of the week. Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to generate insights through graphs and plots, helping to identify trends in user behavior. The notebook format facilitates interactive analysis, while techniques like grouping, filtering, and time-based analysis drive the core of the exploration.

## Installation
The code is written in Jupyter Notebook 7.1 . If you haven't inastlled it you can install it from here(https://www.anaconda.com/download). After installing Anaconda you will see an option to run jupyter notebook and then you can open this file from your respective folder. Once opened you will need to install and import Data visualization Libraries which are mention above. After importing and running those libraries you can proceed with the Analysis.

## Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required libraries listed above in the section(Technology Used).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion
The project helps identify key booking patterns that could inform strategies to enhance booking rates and optimize search processes.
